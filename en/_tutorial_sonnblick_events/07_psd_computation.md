subheadline: "Computation of the power spectral density."
description: "Computation of the power spectral density."
teaser: "Long term spectrograms are useful to evaluate the data quality and periods of special interest. psysmon provides the tools to compute the power spectral density (PSD) for the complete data set which then can be used to create spectrograms for the desired time spans."
