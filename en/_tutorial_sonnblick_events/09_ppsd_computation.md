description: "Computation of the probability power spectral density."
teaser: "The probability power spectral density is a tool that can be used to determine the data quality and eventual problems with the data recorder or the sensor. psysmon provides the tools to compute the probability power spectral density (PPSD) for the complete data set which then can be used to create the PPSD plots for the desired time spans."
