The psysmon documentation is a work in progress. Currently an extensive tutorial describing the usage of psysmon and its most important features is available. In the tutorial [Sonnblick Events][tut-sonnblick-events] the complete workflow from installing psysmon and importing a seismic data set all the way to the detection of seismic events is covered. 

A dedicated user documentation describing the individual psysmon features and an API-documentation is in the making.
